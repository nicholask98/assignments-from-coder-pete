Open the sample program keyboard_example_move_cat.txt and save it as pg3-1-1.py
Add timing to your program. Following are the three things to add to your program:
FPS = ???? # Define with constant
fpsClock = ?????? # Before game loop
fpsClock.???????(??????) # Inside of the loop

3-1-2
Start with program pg3-1-1.py and save it as pg3-1-2.py.
pg3-1-1 must remain in tact. Make the changes to pg3-1-2.
Do not change FPS as part of this exercise.
Create a constant variable:
CAT_SPEED = 5 (or whatever speed you like)
Use CAT_SPEED to determine how many pixels the cat should move when the player presses an arrow key.
